Introduction
=============

This is a product to upload and manage files on issuu.com and use issuu.coms viewer within plone.
The following file types should work
"pdf", "odt", "doc", "wpd", "sxw", "sxi", "rtf", "odp" and "ppt"

Like this: http://products.medialog.no/issuu/grieg-medialog-pdf/view

You should add your issue id etc to /portal_properties (you get a free one at issuu.com ).
(it will work without doing this, but the files will then be store here: http://issuu.com/medialog.issuu/docs (for a limited time))

Warning: this product is still in alpha / beta. It has not been used on any sites yet.

Thanks to Nathan van Gheem and for help and inspiration.
